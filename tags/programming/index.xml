      <description>When it comes to language learning, one approach that I really subscribe to is immersion. This means trying to absorb as much of the language as possible, as often as possible.

      <description>Layerability and Networking An interesting aspect of Networking is how different protocols are layered. For example, to view this page, you had to make an HTTP request. That request was delivered using the TCP protocol, which in turn used the IP protocol, and finally the underlying protocol to send data to your router (skimming a bit over details). Each of these layers only makes use of the one directly beneath it: an implementation of an HTTP client worries about TCP, the TCP code in your OS deals with IP, etc.</description>
