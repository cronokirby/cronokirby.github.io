      <description>This is a short post about a crate I recently published: https://crates.io/crates/ludus. This crate provides the core logic of an NES emulator, and can be used to build independent GUI applications.
Ludus started out as a standalone NES emulator, back in October of 2018. At that point, I had gotten a completely working emulator, aside from some pretty glaring audio issues. I wanted to revisit it at some point, in order to fix the audio.</description>
