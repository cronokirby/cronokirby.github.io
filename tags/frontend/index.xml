      <description>Summary This is a quick post about a &amp;ldquo;gotcha&amp;rdquo; I encountered recently in a React application. This involved the use of React&amp;rsquo;s useState hook, which had a subtle difference between how I thought the hook worked, and how it actually worked.
React Hooks If you&amp;rsquo;re already familiar with hooks in React, feel free to skip this section. This is just a recap for those out of the loop.
Although the first real framework I worked with was Vue (I don&amp;rsquo;t count the one application I built with JQuery as having used a framework), I&amp;rsquo;ve been using React a ton lately, and it&amp;rsquo;s really been growing on me.</description>
