      <description>This is a rough braindump about a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about recently.
A better way of using notes? So i&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering around with better systems for taking notes recently. I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of keeping notes, around because I don&amp;rsquo;t find myself actually revisiting them, and when I do, I don&amp;rsquo;t get much value out of it. On the other hand, my experience with language learning has definitely showed me how effective spaced repetition is when it comes to keeping things in your head.</description>
