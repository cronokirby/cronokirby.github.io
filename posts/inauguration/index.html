    <h1 id="i-made-a-blog-again">I made a blog again</h1>
<p>I think this must be the third iteration of a blog I&rsquo;ve tried and done.</p>
<p>The first was a static site with Jekyll. This went relatively well, but I kind of lost interest in contributing to it,
and I can&rsquo;t even remember if I did post anything noteworthy there. I think I just set the blog up and then never touched it again.
8^)</p>
<p>The second, and much more memorable foray into this whole blogging thing was when I decided to do without a fancy
static site generator, and write a basic markdown -&gt; html conversion thing myself. This was a fun little weekend project,
but I didn&rsquo;t really write that many interesting posts afterward; oh well.
One thing I didn&rsquo;t like about that whole setup was having to deal with styling myself. CSS is most definitely not my forte, especially
when it comes to making the site actually readable on mobile. I made the site look pretty fancy normally, but all of my pretty
box shadows and inlays went to waste as soon as I tested the mobile view, and all the text had gotten smooshed off to the side of the screen;
bummer.</p>
<p>This time (and hopefully the last, at least for a little while) I went with <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">hugo</a>. The experience
so far has been relatively smooth, although I&rsquo;ve had to deal with a few hitches along the way. Most of these were much more my fault
than Hugo&rsquo;s: I was mostly just not familiar with how things worked, and thus somewhat bad at debugging everything. Now that the initial work
has been done, adding posts is silky smooth, which was the goal in the first place, so that&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>Having a full fledged static site is pretty nice. Comments are something that I think add quite a bit to the reading experience, and I&rsquo;m
glad to have them here. I most likely could&rsquo;ve added them to my old hand generated site, but this is much easier on me.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-made-a-blog">Why I made a blog</h2>
<p>When I started writing this post, I thought I should insert a section about why I even want to start writing a blog again. Well, I say again,
but I never really wrote a blog in a consistent way, but I&rsquo;ve wanted to 8^).
I guess there&rsquo;s something nostalgic about the bygone era of personal blogging, especially compared to the current status quo of walled gardens.
It&rsquo;s nice to have some page on the web you can call &ldquo;yours&rdquo;, and from which you can express yourself without too much concern.
A web of personal sites and blogs is pretty darn close to the original stuff at CERN, at least from the little I know about it.
It&rsquo;s definitely a far stretch from a few sites dominating the publishing of technical essays <em>cough</em> medium <em>cough</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what-posts-to-expect">What posts to expect</h2>
<p>I have a few posts in mind so far, and I&rsquo;ll leave those as surprises 8^). My about page has some information about the things I&rsquo;m interested
in, although I really should flesh out that page a bit more, it&rsquo;s quite bare at the moment. The blog will most likely remain fairly technical,
if I wanted to post poetry or stuff like that, I&rsquo;d probably have it on a seperate domain, since I&rsquo;m trying to flesh out this whole space/avatar/whatever this is as a more professional type thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably end up writing my thoughts on certain things, or showing off some code, or even reviewing or talking about books I&rsquo;ve read;
who knows?</p>
