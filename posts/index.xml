      <description>This is a rough braindump about a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about recently.
A better way of using notes? So i&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering around with better systems for taking notes recently. I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of keeping notes, around because I don&amp;rsquo;t find myself actually revisiting them, and when I do, I don&amp;rsquo;t get much value out of it. On the other hand, my experience with language learning has definitely showed me how effective spaced repetition is when it comes to keeping things in your head.</description>

      <title>React Pitfalls: useState initialization</title>

      <description>Summary This is a quick post about a &amp;ldquo;gotcha&amp;rdquo; I encountered recently in a React application. This involved the use of React&amp;rsquo;s useState hook, which had a subtle difference between how I thought the hook worked, and how it actually worked.
React Hooks If you&amp;rsquo;re already familiar with hooks in React, feel free to skip this section. This is just a recap for those out of the loop.
Although the first real framework I worked with was Vue (I don&amp;rsquo;t count the one application I built with JQuery as having used a framework), I&amp;rsquo;ve been using React a ton lately, and it&amp;rsquo;s really been growing on me.</description>

      <description>When it comes to language learning, one approach that I really subscribe to is immersion. This means trying to absorb as much of the language as possible, as often as possible. It&amp;rsquo;s often said that &amp;ldquo;speaking with locals&amp;rdquo; is a good way to accelerate the learning process, and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of truth with that statement.
Comprehensible Input One aspect of immersion that&amp;rsquo;s often overlooked is the idea of comprehensible input.</description>

      <title>Layerability and Abstraction</title>

      <description>Layerability and Networking An interesting aspect of Networking is how different protocols are layered. For example, to view this page, you had to make an HTTP request. That request was delivered using the TCP protocol, which in turn used the IP protocol, and finally the underlying protocol to send data to your router (skimming a bit over details). Each of these layers only makes use of the one directly beneath it: an implementation of an HTTP client worries about TCP, the TCP code in your OS deals with IP, etc.</description>

      <title>Poline</title>

      <description>(Note: this is a first draft)
This is a post about Poline, a tiny programming language I wrote recently. The main &amp;ldquo;gimmick&amp;rdquo; of Poline is a feature called Green Threads. In fact, Poline doesn&amp;rsquo;t have many other features besides them.
Green what? Green Threads are a way of managing concurrency. The core idea is to have many lightweight threads scheduled over fewer OS threads. These tiny threads are then managed by the runtime itself, instead of the OS.</description>

      <title>From Interfaces to Traits</title>

      <description>This is a post about how different languages handle the concept of interfaces. We&amp;rsquo;ll go over the classical OO way of handling them, with Java, to the more recent approaches of languages like Rust, as well as others in between.
Why do we want interfaces? The problem interfaces address is polymorphism. Polymorphic code can work with different types of things in a flexible way. In practice this means functions that can accept different types, and work differently based on those types.</description>

      <description>This is a post about ginkou, a tool I made recently. This tool uses Rust, SQLite, as well as mecab to archive sentences, and then to retrieve them based on the words they contain.
Why would I need this? Unless you&amp;rsquo;re learning Japanese, you probably won&amp;rsquo;t.
With the way I&amp;rsquo;m approaching it, I try and combine words and grammar into the same flashcard system. This means making new flashcarsd with sentences containing small bits of information I&amp;rsquo;m trying to learn.</description>

      <title>Data Races vs Race Conditions</title>

      <guid>/posts/data-races-vs-race-conditions/</guid>
      <description>This is a quick post about the difference between Data Races and Race Conditions, and how data structures or patterns providing freedom from data races can fail to provide race condition freedom.
The examples will be given in Go, since that&amp;rsquo;s a language with a few of the concurrent constructs that come into play here, as well as the language that sparked this blog post in the first place.
Data Races I agree almost entirely with rust&amp;rsquo;s definition of data races.</description>

      <description>This is a short post about a crate I recently published: https://crates.io/crates/ludus. This crate provides the core logic of an NES emulator, and can be used to build independent GUI applications.
Ludus started out as a standalone NES emulator, back in October of 2018. At that point, I had gotten a completely working emulator, aside from some pretty glaring audio issues. I wanted to revisit it at some point, in order to fix the audio.</description>

      <title>The Component Pattern</title>

      <description>This post details a useful pattern for organizing stateful components in functional code. This post assumes knowledge of Haskell, up to Monad-Transformers.
The Problem The organization of a codebase is important: how the files are the laid out, and how the structures inside those files mesh together. A poorly laid out codebase can be difficult to navigate and expand. Poorly laid out code can be hard to understand, and even harder to build upon.</description>

      <title>Bittorrent Is Hard - 1</title>

      <description>About these posts I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a bittorrent client in haskell recently. It&amp;rsquo;s now at the point where it can download torrents in the wild.
The protocol itself is well specified, although it takes a few read-throughs to get the hang of it. The first time I read through the protocol I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand much. But as I started implementing different parts of the protocol, those parts of the document started making more and more sense.</description>

      <title>Notes on Ripple</title>

      <description>mermaid.initialize({startOnLoad: True}); Ripple itself I recently spent a week working on a tiny irc-like service, called ripple. The main difference between ripple and a traditional chat service is the complete lack of a central server.
In this post I explore different ways to organise decentralised services like ripple, and then explain how ripple itself works.
Organisation One of the tougher problems in taking a normal service and decentralising it is how to shape the network.</description>

      <title>Mutability Is a Great Secret To Have</title>

      <description>Resisting the urge for purity There&amp;rsquo;s a very common idea spread around in FP circles that goes something like: &amp;ldquo;Avoid mutable state&amp;rdquo;. This is a good idea, and many articles are out there talking about why this is the case. I agree with these for the most part, but sometimes people lose the forest for the trees when thinking about this goal.
Why do we want to avoid mutability? One of the biggest advantages of reducing mutable state in our code, is reducing the working parts we need to keep track of when reasoning about local pieces of code.</description>

      <description>I made a blog again I think this must be the third iteration of a blog I&amp;rsquo;ve tried and done.
The first was a static site with Jekyll. This went relatively well, but I kind of lost interest in contributing to it, and I can&amp;rsquo;t even remember if I did post anything noteworthy there. I think I just set the blog up and then never touched it again. 8^)
The second, and much more memorable foray into this whole blogging thing was when I decided to do without a fancy static site generator, and write a basic markdown -&amp;gt; html conversion thing myself.</description>
